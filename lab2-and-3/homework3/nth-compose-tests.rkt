;;; This file contains unit tests for the problem listed in the name
;;; of this file.
;;;
;;; To run the tests specify the relative or absolute path to the
;;; ".scm" file with the proposed solution in the (load ...) command
;;; below. Then you can either open the tests and run them in Racket
;;; (with R5RS set as the language), or you can run the following
;;; directly from the command line:
;;;
;;;   plt-r5rs <the-name-of-this-file>
;;;
;;; assuming Racket's bin directory is included in the PATH environment
;;; variable.
;;;
;;; To inspect the actual test cases that are run - look at the
;;; bottom of the file.
